# py-datavolley

A Python package for parsing and analyzing volleyball scouting data from DataVolley files (\*.dvw).

Currently rebuilding with modern Python tooling ([Astral ecosystem](https://docs.astral.sh/)) for improved experience: UV for package management, Ruff for linting/formatting and [Ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) for type checking.
